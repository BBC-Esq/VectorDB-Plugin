The preliminary protective hearing in a dependency case must be held promptly, no later than 72 hours after a child is placed in foster care. If the 72-hour time period expires on a weekend or legal holiday, the hearing must be held on the next day which is not a weekend or legal holiday. Failure to conduct the hearing within the lawful time frames mandates dismissal of the petition without prejudice.
