		<h2 style="color: #f0f0f0;" align="center">What are Vision Models?</h2>
		
		<p>Vision models are large language models specifically trained to create summaries of what an image depicts.
		For purposes of this program, these summaries are then entered into the vector database and can be searched.</p>
		
		<h2 style="color: #f0f0f0;" align="left">Types of Vision Models</h2>
		
		<p>The table below outlines the various vision models available to use in this program.  I highly encourage you to
		test them out (instructions in the Settings portion of this User Guide) before spending the time to process
		a large number of images.</p>
		
		<p><code>Florence2</code> will automatically be selected if you do not have a GPU, but don't let it fool you,
		it is extremely high quality for its size.  In my humble opinion, the highest quality lightweight model is
		<code>Moondream2</code> while the higher quality overall is <code>MiniCPM-v-2.6 - 8b</code>, but feel free
		to experiment because you may like the style of a particular one.</p>

		<h2 style="color: #f0f0f0;" align="center">Tips</h2>
		
		<p>The number of parameters does directly correlate with quality.  The vision models in this program came out at
		different times (i.e. technical advancements) by different vendors and quality can vary accordingly.  For example,
		you might prefer <code>Llava 1.6 - Vicuna 7b</code> over <code>Llava 1.5 13b</code>.</p>
		
		<p>Make sure your chunk size setting is at least as large as the longest summary that you expect the vision model
		will create. You DO NOT want the summary of a single image to be split, which will lead to poor search results.
		This is yet another reason to test the models first, to see the length of their summaries as well as their quality.</p>
		
		<p>Unless you absolutely need a database with both images and documents, I recommend an "images only" database.</p>
