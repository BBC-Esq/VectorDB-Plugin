		<h2 style="color: #f0f0f0;" align="center">What are Vision Models?</h2>
		
		<p>For purposes of this program, vision models refer to large language models specifically trained to create summaries
		of what an image depicts.  These summaries are then entered into the vector database and can be searched.</p>
		
		<h2 style="color: #f0f0f0;" align="left">Types of Vision Models</h2>
		
		<p>The table below outlines the various vision models available to use in this program.  I highly encourage you to
		test them out (instructions in the Settings portion of this User Guide) before spending the time to process
		a large number of images only to find out you don't like the quality of the one you chose.</p>
		
		<p>Whichever vision model is selected when you create the vector database will be used.  There is no need to
		click the "update settings" button to ensure this.</p>
		
		<p><code>Florence2</code> will automatically be selected if you do not have a GPU, but don't let it fool you.
		It is extremely high quality for its size.  My favorite is <code>Moondream2</code> when weighing quality,
		compute time, and resources.  When only considering quality, however, IMHO it's a toss-up between
		<code>Moondream2</code>, <code>COGVLM</code>, and the recently-added <code>MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2_5-int4</code></p>.
		Nowadays, the models have gotten so good it's difficult to distinguish.</p>

		<h2 style="color: #f0f0f0;" align="center">Tips</h2>
		
		- Test all vision models first, as outlined in the Settings portion of this User Guide.
		
		<p>The number of parameters DOES NOT always correlate with quality.  The vision models in this program came out at
		different times (i.e. technical advancements) by different vendors and quality can vary accordingly.</p>
		
		<p>Make sure your chunk size setting is at least as large as the longest summary that you expect the vision model
		will create. You DO NOT want the summary of a single image to be split, which will lead to nonsensical search results.</p>
		
		<p>I recommend that if you are putting images in your database choose a chunk size of at least 500-800, but test out
		the average chunks size for image descriptions in the Tools Tab first.</p>
		
		<p>Unless you need a database with both images and documents, it's good practice to have an "images only" database.</p>
